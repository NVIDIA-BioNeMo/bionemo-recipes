# Adapt Phage Execution

Work inside the recipe and result roots selected by the controller.

Discover enough of the current environment to run the approved scientific stages: repository commands and help, installed environment, storage, CPUs, GPU count/model/memory/occupancy, scheduler or cloud facilities, network constraints, and existing jobs. Follow the shared [command and asset guidance](../bionemo-phage-design/references/command-and-asset-guidance.md). Avoid printing credentials.

An agent sandbox or container can hide host GPUs. A failed `nvidia-smi`, missing `/dev/nvidia*`, or false CUDA-availability result inside that boundary does not prove the host lacks GPUs or drivers. With permission, repeat the probe in a host-visible context before changing drivers, switching to CPU, or reducing the intended topology. If that is unavailable, say what remains unknown and provide the host-side probe.

Choose among local, SSH, Slurm, Lepton, or manual execution from what is actually available. Follow the concise [infrastructure guidance](references/infrastructure-guidance.md), local site policy, and existing repository or user-provided scripts; do not assume a particular mechanism. Build the recipe with `./.ci_build.sh` before sourcing `.ci_test_env.sh`.

Use the [compute guidance](references/compute-guidance.md) and a bounded full-shape smoke test to size training, RL, generation, and computational filters. Preserve whole-genome context and the intended effective batch. Respond to memory pressure from measurements rather than silently changing the scientific task.

Use a durable job facility for long work and record its job ID, command, result directory, and log location. Reattach after reconnecting. Check startup, then poll at the cadence of useful progress; distinguish submission from completion and trainer progress from tracker liveness. Follow the user's agreed run budget and scientific continuation decisions rather than automatically relaunching completed segments. W&B is optional unless requested; local logs remain useful when a tracker fails.
