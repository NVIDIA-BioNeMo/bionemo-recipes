# Operate NeMo-RL Phage Training

Work inside the recipe and result roots selected by the controller. Use the selected SFT checkpoint, approved objectives, and calibrated prompt/sampling settings. Before readiness, create or validate `RESULT_ROOT/rl/sft-checkpoint` with `evo2_phage_prepare_sft_checkpoint_for_rl`; pass the preparation manifest's direct model-only `iter_*` path to readiness and NeMo-RL as both policy initialization and the fixed SFT KL anchor. Keep the original full-state SFT checkpoint for SFT resume rather than asking NeMo-RL workers to deserialize its process-local training callbacks.

The preparation manifest must have `schema_version: 2` and `model_object_state_preserved: true`. If strict loading reports a missing Transformer Engine `_extra_state` object shard and the matching preparation is schema 1, rerun the same top-level command: preparation atomically rebuilds that derived checkpoint while retaining the full-state SFT source and completed calibration. Do not weaken checkpoint strictness or patch NeMo-RL workers around an incomplete payload.

Treat materialized training and validation prompt banks as run artifacts: readiness must check the result-root training bank, and the launch must use the matching result-root train/validation paths. When resuming the PhiX174 example, rerunning the same top-level command recreates missing banks and creates or reuses the prepared SFT checkpoint without repeating completed calibration; do not satisfy readiness by copying a run-specific bank into the shared template path. When adapting to a different NeMo-RL release or infrastructure, inspect the installed configuration classes and that release's upstream `examples/configs`; wheels may omit the examples.

At the pilot and before full launch, reconcile the approved objective artifact, configured objective set, and emitted telemetry. A discrepancy is a diagnosis input, not an automatic stop or user wait. Continue with the strongest scientifically defensible portfolio, treating removal of an agreed term as a last resort and keeping unavailable terms visible in telemetry.

Record added, omitted, or redefined terms; their evidence and consequences; controls or restoration criteria; and the objective-set version and change point. Summarize key decisions in the next user update and whenever asked, without pausing useful work merely to obtain acknowledgment.

Before the full run, execute a small full-shape preflight with positive and failure controls. Confirm every enabled reward runs, produces finite values in `[0, 1]`, is logged separately, and handles short genomes, missing genes/ORFs, empty tool output, invalid observations, and tool failure without crashing or receiving accidental positive credit. Confirm checkpoint writing and restart.

Retain the first sampled EOD and its log-probability in each row's policy trajectory, mask synthetic padding, and score biological sequence only before EOD. During top-k/top-p policy replay, keep every sampled action in normalized target-preserving support; never zero an `-inf` log-probability or drop its action, and retain generation-versus-replay mismatch telemetry. Size generation `max_model_len` to the longest tokenized prompt plus `max_new_tokens`, rounded to the allocator block boundary. Select paged-KV offset width from each view's reachable strided storage span; keep MCore's original append for spans at or below signed `INT32_MAX` and widen pointer operands before multiplication above it.

Also guard the local GLU output span `train_micro_batch × sequence_length × ceil(ffn_width / TP)` below signed `INT32_MAX`; DP does not reduce that local shape. If native generation uses `offload` or `recompute`, verify the mode reaches MCore's `InferenceConfig`, deallocate after rollout, restore before reuse, and recapture graphs whenever restored cache/state pointers can change—a config value alone is not evidence that memory was released.
Capacity qualification must start with training rather than validation and complete at least two
optimizer updates at full shape: optimizer state first materializes during the first update, so a
one-update pass is not steady-state evidence. Because validation can allocate or capture persistent
state, also complete a validation followed by another optimizer update before qualifying the
setting. Expandable allocator segments can fix fragmentation but cannot compensate for retained
cache or optimizer state.

Do not qualify filtered sampling by silently masking mismatched rows. Compare every active sampled action's generation log-probability with a full teacher-forced policy replay using the exact prompt, completion, checkpoint, sampling transform, and EOD handling. Include both EOD-terminated and length-capped rows. Report per-token and per-sequence error before applying the configured mismatch guard, plus error grouped by absolute token position modulo the paged-KV block size. Any rejected row, non-finite value, or boundary-localized spike is a `diagnose` result even when the aggregate median is small. A lone finite, non-boundary per-token tail that leaves the configured per-sequence statistic accepted is an inspect-and-record advisory, not by itself an automatic hold: do not reuse a sequence-level threshold as a per-token kill switch. Escalate it when it recurs, clusters, changes the aggregate distribution, or crosses a separately calibrated hard per-token guard. Requalify across at least two complete generation→replay/refit cycles at the deployed batch shape, topology, precision, graph scope, page size, and KV-index dispatch; a smaller BF16/TP profile or a forward-only unit approximation does not qualify a different FP8/TP rollout profile.

Treat a pilot that partitions mixed prompt lengths into sequential decode waves or falls back to
single-request generation as an operational failure. The packed native adapter must send the full
mixed-length request group in one call and preserve row order; accept the pilot marker only after
the configured full-shape group uses packed batched prefill and decode. Leave optimizer retention
during generation disabled unless a disposable full-shape pilot establishes sufficient HBM capacity
through a complete train→generation→train cycle.

For the realized PhiX pilot and resume procedure, read the
[example README](../../examples/README.md) as the source of truth. Preserve separate durable states
for the pilot, its objective-health check, and the full RL run; skip a state only after its output
is known to have completed successfully.

Save native Megatron-Bridge `torch_dist` checkpoints: set `checkpointing.model_save_format: null`, keep `checkpointing.save_consolidated: false`, `policy.megatron_cfg.enabled: true`, and `policy.dtensor_cfg.enabled: false`, and omit `_v2`. NeMo-RL writes `step_N/policy/weights/iter_0000000`, which this recipe resumes from and gives directly to Megatron rollout. Named formats such as `safetensors` belong to the Automodel/DTensor path, not this worker. Updating this recipe config in an editable checkout does not require `evo2_phage_setup_nemo_rl --force-reinstall`; rerun the failed pilot from the same top-level result root.

Validate the configured checkpoint-selection metric against the actual validation metric names.
The recipe's phage OpenAI-format dataset assigns both training and validation the stable task name
`phage_qc` regardless of their result-root JSONL paths. The environment hook returns bare metric
keys and NeMo-RL adds that task namespace exactly once, so the strict PhiX checkpoint endpoint is
`val:phage_qc/binary_safety_qualified_full_qc_cluster_deduplicated_rate`. A logged `rl-train/` or
`rl-validation/` prefix means the path-naming generic dataset was used; restore the recipe dataset
rather than encoding the path into the checkpoint metric. Timing-marker keys remain unnamespaced
for phase reporting. A missing metric is an integration error to diagnose; do not switch to another
target environment or biological profile merely to make a key appear.

TensorBoard objective monitoring must discover the newest complete validation namespace containing
both `mean_reward` and `num_sequences`. Current recipe runs normally emit `validation/phage_qc/...`,
while older path-named runs may emit `validation/rl-validation/...`; do not hard-code the unscoped
`validation/mean_reward` path or confuse these logging paths with the configured checkpoint metric.

Choose topology and batch settings from measured full-genome behavior. Preserve complete-genome context and the intended effective batch. Use GDPO and 99%-cluster inverse-frequency diversity for the default case study unless evidence supports another approved method.

Follow the concise [monitoring guidance](references/monitoring-guidance.md). `max_num_steps` is a safety ceiling, not a target. At every fixed-bank validation event, persist a `continue | diagnose | stop | restart` decision from both validation and training-rollout evidence before extending beyond the next decision boundary. Set cadence to reveal sustained change without applying SFT-style patience to noisy RL; do not stop after a token number of steps or select the latest checkpoint automatically.

Select a checkpoint from sustained validation quality and diversity using the approved component set. Do not compare aggregate scores across different component sets as if they were the same metric. A compatible full-state resume retains its original selected SFT checkpoint as the KL reference. Treat weights-only recovery as a new attempt anchored to that non-RL SFT checkpoint; use prior RL weights as a new baseline only for an explicitly approved stage change. Start a new attempt when objectives, prompts, data, or model semantics materially change.

Record the command, settings, environment, job/checkpoint locations, validation series, interruptions/resumes, selected checkpoint and rationale, and important failure diagnoses in the stage summary and `RUNLOG.md`.
