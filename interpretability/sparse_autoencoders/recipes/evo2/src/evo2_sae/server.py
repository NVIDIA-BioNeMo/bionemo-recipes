"""FastAPI server over the Evo2SAE engine — the live backend the viz talks to.

Endpoints (under /api): /api/health, /api/features, /api/annotate (per-base activations for a
pasted sequence), /api/generate (autoregressive generation + optional SAE-feature clamp). The
/api prefix lets a prebuilt frontend be served from "/" on the same origin (single-container
deploy); when no frontend is configured the server is API-only. This is a thin layer; all model
work lives in `core.Evo2SAE`.
